### Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG) 

AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model's cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).


### 📜 Concepts

A typical RAG application has two main components:

📌 Indexing: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline.

📌 Retrieval and generation: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.
